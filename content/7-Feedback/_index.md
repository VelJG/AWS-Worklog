### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment is very friendly and open. FCJ members are always willing to help whenever I encounter difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is comfortable, helping me focus better. However due to the large amount of other students, chances to work on the office are small, so we mostly did our work remotely 

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
The mentors are very keen to help us with our project and questions, and organized Workshops and Events to provide important knowledge with us 

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
AWS Services and other Cloud Services are almost unknown to me before applying for OJT at AWS FCJ, but the internship help me greatly learn about Cloud and how crucial it is to my academic major. My project: Automated AWS Incident Response and Forensics System was more relevant to the Information Assurance field-different from the Software Engineering field- but still it was a great learning exeperience about overall security knowledge and improve our hands-on with AWS Services

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
During the internship, I learnt many new skills such as: Working with AWS and other Cloud Services, the Python coding language for our project, improved my leadership skill with leading the project and team member while mostly remote

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but still keeps things enjoyable, many of the mentors are around our age and very friendly. I appriciate my team very much, everyone is capable and willing to learn new thing, and they are proactive and do all the tasks as best they can. We also care for eachother, and check up eachother not only on tasks but overall health as around the final phase of the project, we all try our best to finish in time of the deadline  

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The company offers flexible working hours when needed, mostly they enables us to work remotely. In addition, the company introduced us to AWS Study Group and organized events about important informations in our field

### Additional Questions
- What did you find **most satisfying** during your internship? 
- Answer: Figuring how to work with AWS Services and configured their policies correctly in the process of building our project
   
- What do you think the company **should improve** for future interns?
- Answer: More spaces on the office would be nice but it would be hard to accommodate this condition. Another thing is the midterm test where most of us underestimated the scope of the exam, not knowing it would be around the same format as a SAA Certificate Exam. If we had known such big scope, we would know how to prepare ourselves better   
  
- If recommending to a friend, would you **suggest they intern here**? Why or why not?  
- Answer: Yes but only if the friend have already found a good team and disciplined enough to do their work remotely, I have seen other OJT interns have a very hard time with the internship because they randomly choose a team with little support for eachother and low correspondence
