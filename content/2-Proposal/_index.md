## 1. Background and Motivation

### 1.1 Executive Summary

Our team is building an automated incident response and forensics solution as part of the AWS First Cloud Journey internship program. The idea is straightforward—when a security issue happens in AWS, we want the system to respond automatically without waiting for manual intervention.

We're creating a platform that automatically detects security findings from GuardDuty, isolates affected resources, captures forensic evidence through comprehensive data collection, and provides analytics and dashboards where security teams can investigate what happened. Everything is built using Infrastructure-as-Code with AWS CDK, so customers can easily deploy it into their own AWS accounts.

The main use cases include detecting unauthorized AWS credential use, identifying compromised EC2 instances, and ensuring forensic data is properly collected, processed, and stored for investigation. Our architecture integrates VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail, and GuardDuty to detect threats, while Step Functions orchestrates the automated response workflow including EC2 isolation, ASG detachment, and IAM quarantine. All evidence is collected and processed through custom ETL Lambda and Data Firehose, using Athena for forensic analysis.

### 1.2 Project Success Criteria

We measure success through these key objectives:

* Successfully deploy a fully functional incident response orchestrator that customers can use immediately after installation
* Reduce investigation time from hours to minutes by automating evidence collection and response
* Ensure all forensic evidence is properly collected, processed, and stored
* Deliver everything on schedule within our 6-week timeline
* Keep deployment costs under $5/month for typical usage
* Enable all team members to demonstrate competency in AWS security services, serverless architecture, forensics collection, and web application protection.

### The Problem We Want to Solve

The increasing frequency and sophistication of cyber threats pose significant risks to organizations relying on cloud infrastructure. Manual incident response processes are often slow, inconsistent, and prone to human error, which can lead to prolonged system downtime, data breaches, and financial losses. The project aims to address these challenges by developing an automated, reliable, and scalable incident response system that minimizes response time, enhances forensic capabilities, and reduces operational costs.

### Benefits

* Rapid threat detection and automated response reduce the window of vulnerability.
* Automated forensic data collection ensures comprehensive evidence gathering, facilitating faster investigations.
* Cost-effective deployment leveraging AWS serverless services minimizes infrastructure expenses.
* Improved security posture through continuous monitoring and real-time alerts.
* Empowers security teams with actionable insights via dashboards and analytics.
* Scalable architecture adaptable to organizations of various sizes and incident volumes.

### 1.3 Assumptions

**Customer Assumptions:**

* Customers have an AWS account with appropriate permissions to deploy our CDK application.
* Customers have basic familiarity with AWS services and can run simple CLI and CMD commands.
* GuardDuty is already enabled or customers are willing to enable it as part of setup.
* Customers want a self-contained solution for the initial deployment.
* The team has consistent access to AWS during the 6-week project period.

**Dependencies and Constraints:**

* Our solution integrates with AWS native services only (at the moment).
* Forensics collection includes VPC Flow Logs, DNS Logs, CloudTrail, and EC2 snapshot.
* We use services available on the free tier or low-cost services (Lambda, Step Functions, Data Firehose, Athena).
* All infrastructure is defined in AWS CDK (Python) for reproducible deployment.
* Dashboard is static S3-hosted with Cognito authentication, CloudFront CDN.
* We follow AWS Well-Architected Framework principles throughout.

### Risk Mitigation

To address the potential challenges associated with implementing AWS services and forensic data processing at scale, a comprehensive risk mitigation plan should be adopted. This plan includes the following measures:

* **Training and Skill Development:** Beyond initial training, establish ongoing education programs and certifications for team members to stay updated with AWS advancements and best practices. This reduces the learning curve and enhances operational efficiency.
* **Robust Performance Optimization:** Regularly review and fine-tune Athena queries and Data Firehose configurations. Implement automated monitoring tools to detect performance bottlenecks early and adjust resources dynamically to maintain optimal throughput.
* **Data Security and Compliance:** Incorporate strict security protocols, including encryption, access controls, and audit logging, to safeguard sensitive forensic data. Ensure compliance with relevant regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, or industry-specific standards.
* **Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity:** Develop and test disaster recovery plans that include data backups, failover procedures, and redundancy measures to minimize downtime and data loss during failures.
* **Scalability Planning:** Anticipate future data growth and workload increases by designing scalable architecture. Use auto-scaling features and cost management tools to optimize resource utilization and control expenses.
* **Vendor and Technology Evaluation:** Continuously evaluate AWS service updates and alternative solutions to ensure the chosen tools remain effective and cost-efficient as requirements evolve.

Implementing these enhanced risk mitigation strategies will provide a more resilient framework for managing the complexities of forensic data processing and cloud service deployment, ultimately reducing operational risks and ensuring data integrity and security.

## 2. Solution Architecture / Architectural Diagram

### 2.1 Technical Architecture Diagram

![AWS Architecture](../2-Proposal/AWSWorkshopArchitecture-Stepfunctions.drawio.png)

Our solution uses a comprehensive multi-stage architecture for automated incident response and forensics:

#### Data Collection & Detection Layer

The system collects security events from multiple sources:

* **VPC Flow Logs and DNS Logs** from network interfaces capture network traffic patterns.
* **CloudTrail** logs all AWS API calls and management activities.
* **EC2 Instances** generate system-level telemetry.
* **GuardDuty** continuously monitors for security threats and suspicious activity.
* **CloudWatch** collects metrics and logs from AWS resources.

#### Event Processing Layer

When GuardDuty detects a finding:

* **Event Bridge** routes findings to our Step Functions.
* Events are classified by type to determine response action.

#### Automated Response Orchestration (Step Functions Workflow)

Our Step Functions state machine orchestrates the incident response with these sequential actions:

1. **Parse Findings** - Extract critical information from security event.
2. **Finding Type** - Decision point to determine response strategy.
3. **Isolate EC2** - Remove compromised instance from production and isolate them.
4. **Termination Protection & Tagging** - Protect instance and tag for forensics.
5. **Detach ASG** - Detach from Auto Scaling Group.
6. **Create Snapshot** - Capture EBS volume for forensic analysis.
7. **Quarantine IAM** - Isolate credentials and permissions.

#### Alerting & Notification Layer

* **Amazon SNS** distributes alerts to multiple channels.
* **Alert Dispatch** routes notifications appropriately.
* **Simple Email Service (SES)** sends email notifications.
* **Third-party messaging platform (Slack)** delivers real-time alerts to security teams.

#### Data Processing & Analytics Layer

Collected forensic data flows through:

* **CloudWatch** logs for immediate analysis.
* **Raw Log Data** stored in S3 for long-term retention.
* **DATA ETL** pipeline processes raw data.
* **Data Firehose** streams processed data to S3 bucket.
* **Processed Data** storage for normalized forensic information.
* **Athena** enables SQL queries against forensic datasets.

#### Dashboard & Analysis Layer

Security analysts access investigation tools through:

* **Dashboard Query** interface for investigations.
* **API Gateway** provides programmatic access to forensic data.
* **Athena** delivers real-time SQL query results.
* **S3 Static Dashboard** provides visual investigation interface.
* **Cognito** handles authentication and authorization.
* **CloudFront** CDN accelerates dashboard delivery.

**Output & Notification:**

* Final alerts and findings are sent to **Slack and Email**.
* **Users** (security team) receive actionable intelligence for investigation.

### 2.2 Technical Plan

Our team develops the entire solution using AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) with Python. CDK allows us to write infrastructure as code, enabling version control, testing, and easy customization by customers.

**Approach:**

Create a CDK project with modular constructs representing each architectural layer:
* Detection layer (GuardDuty, CloudWatch, EventBridge integration, CloudTrail).
* Orchestration layer (Step Functions, Lambda functions for each action).
* Data collection layer (Data Firehose, S3 storage, ETL processes).
* Analytics layer (Athena, dashboards, API Gateway, CloudFront).
* Notification layer (SNS, SES, third-party integrations).

**Step Functions Workflow:**
* State machine with decision logic based on finding type.
* Findings trigger immediate containment (EC2 isolation, ASG detachment, IAM quarantine).

**Step Functions:**
Written in Python for AWS SDK compatibility.

Specific responsibilities:
* **Parse Findings (Lambda)** - Extract and normalize GuardDuty data.
* **Isolate EC2 (Lambda)** - Modify security groups and remove from load balancers.
* **Protect Instance** - Set termination protection and forensic tags.
* **Detachment from ASG** - Detach instance from auto scaling group.
* **Create Snapshot** - Initiate EBS snapshot for forensic analysis.
* **Quarantine IAM (Lambda)** - Apply restrictive policies to compromised credentials.

Separation of concerns enables easy testing and independent updates.

**Data Collection Pipeline:**
* Logs exported from CloudWatch and CloudTrail.
* Lambda-based ETL normalizes data formats.
* Data Firehose streams processed forensic data to S3 with automatic partitioning.
* Athena tables created for efficient SQL queries.

**Dashboard Development:**
* Static S3-hosted HTML/CSS/JavaScript (React) interface.
* Cognito integration for authentication.
* API Gateway connects dashboard to Lambda functions.
* Real-time query results from Athena.
* CloudFront CDN caches dashboard and query results.

**Testing:**
* Integration tests simulating real GuardDuty findings.
* End-to-end tests validating complete response workflows.

## 6. Resources & Cost Estimates

**Resource Breakdown**

| Resource | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Huỳnh An Khương** | Coordination, Architecture design, CDK, GuardDuty, Lambda, ETL Pipeline, Forensic analysis |
| **Mai Quốc Anh** | Project Management (Jira), Alerting (Email/Telegram), Authentication, Dashboard design, Proposal. |

The cost was too low for us to actually account for the Rate(USD)/Hour cost.

**Hours by Project Phase**

| Project Phase | Huỳnh An Khương | Mai Quốc Anh | Lâm Gia Kiệt | Nguyễn Trần Minh Quân | Lê Trần Gia Huy | Total Hours |
| ---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| *Foundation* | 30 | 30 | 30 | 30 | 30 | 150 |
| *Core Orchestration* | 30 | 30 | 30 | 30 | 30 | 150 |
| *Analytics Layer* | 30 | 30 | 30 | 30 | 30 | 150 |
| *Testing & Validation* | 30 | 30 | 30 | 30 | 30 | 150 |
| *Documentation & Handover* | 30 | 30 | 30 | 30 | 30 | 150 |
| **Total Hours** | **150** | **150** | **150** | **150** | **150** | **750** |

It’s not easy to get the exact time we spent on the project, though we average 5 hours per day on it, so I’ll write 5 for every single day.

**Cost Distribution**

| Party | Contribution (USD) | % of Total |
| ---: | :--- | :---: |
| *AWS FCJ Program* | $0 (Non-profit internship) | 0% (academic credit) |
| *FPT University* | Student labor (internship) | 0% (academic credit) |
| *AWS* | $15 (Including running for testing.) | 100% |
| **Total Project Cost** | **$15** | **100%** |

This is cost-effective because team members are completing this as their internship (counting toward academic requirements), and AWS covers infrastructure costs through the FCJ program.
