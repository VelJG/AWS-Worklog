### Key Highlights

### Event Experience

The event was very informative and right on time as our team was setting up CloudFront the night before. The new pricing system is so much better for us, with additional WAF for security

The workshop was very interactive and fun, with Mr.Julian being as supportive as possible too
We got our questions answered my Mr.Julian after the event too:

Q: WAF can be used control and block bot activities, but lately but the improvement of AI: Especially Gemini's new Agent, which can directly interact on our browser, not headless, can WAF help protect against those?

A: Well with Gemini, the interractions are still called by an API so WAF can detect that, but there is another that we cant detect, Claude Agent, but its only an accessibilty tool and doesnt do many harmful things normal bots do so in the near future we wont need to concern it yet
