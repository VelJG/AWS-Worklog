### Needs Improvement

* While remote work was manageable, my overall productivity level was not as high as it would be in an office environment
* Havent communicate enough with mentors and others FCJ Members as i had wanted   
* Need to learn how to divide workload better and not keep too much work to myself causing burnt-out, luckily my team members are very proactive and urged me to assign more tasks to them
