### Week 3 Achievements:

* Successfully upgraded the AWS account to complete labs previously unavailable on the Free Tier and learned to adapt resources, such as fixing outdated Lambda runtime versions.

Advanced Storage (FSx): Completed Lab 25, creating and configuring an Amazon FSx file system. Gained practical skills in managing data deduplication, creating shadow copies for backup, setting user quotas, and scaling throughput while monitoring performance with CloudWatch.

* Completed Module 5 theory and extensive security labs:

  *  Learnt concepts of IAM, Roles, Policies, Cognito, Organizations, Identity Center (SSO), and KMS.

  *  Implemented Region Restriction policies (Lab 28 & 30) for EC2 creation and access.

  *  Configured Role Conditions to restrict access based on IP and time (Lab 44).

  *  Practiced securing file uploads to S3 using IAM Roles instead of access keys (Lab 48).

* Enabled Security Hub and AWS Config (Lab 18), achieving a security score of 85% and identifying a critical exposure (IAM User administrative access).

* Created Lambda functions to schedule the start and stop of EC2 instances based on tags (Lab 22) and logged notifications via Slack.

* Successfully navigated kernel compatibility issues by selecting the correct Ubuntu version (22.04), imported a VM to AWS, created an AMI, and exported the instance back into the .OVA format (Lab 14).

* Set up an AWS Organization, created Organizational Units (OUs) and accounts, configured Service Control Policies, and practiced switching roles for accounts (Lab 12).

* AWS for Microsoft Workloads: Completed additional labs focused on:

  *  Managing users/groups in Microsoft AD via AWS CLI.

  *  Advanced EC2 troubleshooting by detaching and re-attaching volumes.

  *  Attaching licenses to EC2 instances using Microsoft AD (demonstrated with Libre Office).

* Set up CloudTrail to log data to S3 and used Amazon Athena to query these logs for audit and security analysis (Lab 33).
