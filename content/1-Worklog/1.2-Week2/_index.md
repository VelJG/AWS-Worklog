| 6   | - Retry Lab 10: <br>&emsp; + Fix given template: Region changed to ap-southeast-1, instance changed to t3.micro <br>&emsp; + Successfully configured endpoints and rules in Route 53 for hybrid DNS <br>&emsp; + Succesfully deployed Microsoft AD<br> - Lab 8:<br>&emsp; + Viewed metrics and graph using Cloudwatch on selected EC2 Instances <br>&emsp; + Learnt the basics on monitoring logs <br>&emsp; + 8.4.2: cannot be done: Cant find the resource s3://workshop-template-bucket/logger.py . <br>&emsp; + Configured Cloudwatch Alarm and Dashboard  <br> - Lab 14: Installing Ubuntu <br> - Reformatted worklog <br> - Wrote about Cloud Day 2025 experiences <br><br> - Additional research on AWS Well Architected Framework: <br>&emsp; + Documents a set of foundational questions that enable you to understand how a specific architecture aligns with cloud best practices <br>&emsp; **+ Purpose:** <br>&emsp;&emsp; • A cloud service for reviewing and measuring your workloads against AWS best practices to build more secure, resilient, high-performing, and cost-effective systems.<br>&emsp;&emsp; • Core Function: Identifies High Risk Issues (HRIs) and Medium Risk Issues (MRIs) in your architecture and provides an improvement plan to mitigate them. <br>&emsp; **+ Usage:** <br>&emsp;&emsp; • Step 1: Define a Workload: Specify the name, environment, owner, and regions for the application or system you are reviewing.<br>&emsp;&emsp; • Step 2: Document the State: Answer questions based on the pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework (Security, Reliability, etc.) and save a "milestone" to capture your progress.<br>&emsp;&emsp; • Step 3: Review the Improvement Plan: The tool generates a prioritized list of risks (HRIs and MRIs) based on your answers.<br>&emsp;&emsp; • Step 4: Make Improvements & Measure: Update your architecture based on the plan, then update your answers in the tool to track the reduction in risks over time <br>&emsp; **+ Key Features:** <br>&emsp;&emsp; • Workloads: The central component representing your application; can be viewed, edited, shared, and deleted. <br>&emsp;&emsp; • Lenses: Provide focused questions for specific technologies (e.g., Serverless Lens) or industries. You can also create Custom Lenses for internal standards. <br>&emsp;&emsp; • Review Templates & Profiles: Help standardize reviews by pre-filling common answers (Templates) and prioritizing questions based on business goals (Profiles). <br>&emsp;&emsp; • Jira Integration: Allows you to sync improvement items directly from the Well-Architected Tool into your Jira projects as epics, tasks, and sub-tasks for streamlined tracking. <br>&emsp; **+ Security:** <br>&emsp;&emsp; • Shared Responsibility Model: AWS secures the cloud infrastructure, while you are responsible for securing your workloads in the cloud. <br>&emsp;&emsp; • IAM Integration: Access is controlled through AWS IAM, with pre-built policies for full access and read-only access. <br>&emsp;&emsp; • Data Protection: Recommends using IAM users (not root), enabling MFA, and avoiding placing sensitive data in free-form text fields. <br>&emsp;&emsp; • Monitoring & Auditing: Integrates with AWS CloudTrail to log all API activity and with Amazon EventBridge to trigger automated notifications.  | 19/09/2025 | 20/09/2025      | [Vietnam Cloud Day Experience](4-EventParticipated/4.1-Event1/) [AWS Well Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/userguide/intro.html) |


### Week 2 Achievements:

* Utilized Linux via EC2 to install and run a MySQL database and deploy a connected web application, successfully hosting the database using RDS (Relational Database Service).

* Successfully set up a Load Balancer and Target Groups, and adapted to a discontinued tool by installing and using Siege on an EC2 instance to execute a load test.

* Configured Route 53 endpoints and rules for a hybrid DNS setup, including the deployment of Microsoft AD.

* Gained foundational knowledge in cloud monitoring by viewing metrics and graphs in CloudWatch, configuring Alarms and Dashboards, and learning the basics of log management.

* Team Support: Assisted team members with labs, identifying and helping to correct missing steps in the lab instructions.

* Attended the AWS Cloud Day 2025 HCM Event (Gen AI and Data track).

* Optional Research: Completed research on the AWS Well-Architected Framework, documenting its purpose, usage steps, key features (Lenses, Templates, Profiles), and security considerations.

* Technical Setup: Successfully installed Ubuntu on a machine and reformatted the worklog for improved presentation.
